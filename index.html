			<h1>Hey, I'm Arthur, nice to meet you.</h1>
			<p>Full-stack Web Developer, currently living in Spring, Texas. I create custom websites and web apps to help other businesses excel in a digital era.</p>
			<p>I'm obsessed with nature, and I reflect that in my work by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Designing beautiful web products. (Nature is the epitome of beauty)</li>
				<li>Ensuring those products have a natural flow. (Nature flows, and isn't rigid)</li>
				<li>Coding said products with elegance. (No better presence of elegance in the world, than nature)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>My name is Arthur, I'm a Full-stack Web Developer currently living in Spring, Texas.</p>
			<article>
				<p>From the time of my early youth, I've been fascinated by how electronics work, and how information was increasingly becoming digitized. Combine that with my obsession with nature and you get somone with a strong passion for crafting quality code, that results in functional, secure, and aesthetically focused web products that feel smooth, and have a natural flow.</p>

			<article>
				<p>I love working with and collaborating with others. Not only does it keep the design and build process exciting, the brainstorming that team environments prioritize usually results in the most functional and creative end results!</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<p>When I'm not designing or coding you can find this ENTP either face down in some article about a new technology, or facing down a large hill on my longboard. If I'm mot reading or bombing a hill, I'm jamming good music, playing hockey, playing video games with friends, or camping!</p>
